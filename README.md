# PrismUI

PrismUI is an early-stage, TypeScript-first React UI library focused on building a clean, modern, and beautiful component set.

## Why PrismUI

- **Beautiful by default**: modern visuals with a consistent design language.
- **React-first**: no framework lock-in; works in any React app.
- **Theme-friendly**: global, component-level customization through a single theme.
- **Type-safe**: strong TypeScript ergonomics and IDE autocomplete.

## Inspirations

PrismUI learns from:

- **Mantine**: architecture, component patterns, theming ergonomics.
- **MUI / Joy UI**: visual design, tokens, and practical component UX.

## Status

PrismUI is under active development. The core infrastructure is being built first, followed by the first batch of components.
